# SprunkGuard-Detection
SprunkGuard Detection is a concept to detect a SprunkGuard Health Hackers in GTA SA:MP. I originally developed this code back in  2014.

#### Yes, I'm aware of the absurd amount of commentation.
Context: I used these snippets to apply for a scripter position of different SA:MP servers. I'd dev for random servers just to improve my coding knowledge and learn new things.

SprunkGuard Detection - Yisui Chaos

Introduction:

This has been something that has been bothering me for a long time. I have a good
idea that could fight against it. It has a 100% accuracy, I&#39;ve tested it hundreds of times
with many different methods and this is what I&#39;ve complied together. Please read

carefully.

Idea:
The idea is quite simple.

A script to detect the famously overused SprunkGuard

Explanation:

Force a player into a plane, if the plane takes damage, the player is hacking. Normally if
a player is forced into a vehicle, the vehicle won&#39;t take damageâ€¦ but due to the solid
transparent/nontransparent sprunk machines on the players side, the vehicle would
indeed take damage. This in itself proves the player is using client sided objects(e.g.
sprunk machines) to block shots from connecting to his character.

Script:

Is this possible through script? Yes it is. As a knowledgeable scripter myself,
experienced in many different languages I can tell you, it is very possible. I will also
provide an example I scripted and tested on local server. It only took me about 30-45
minutes to script this. It is a very easy update to do. I have taken some time to put all
of this together and spent even more time testing it. So please don&#39;t criticize my effort,
I am honestly trying to make a change in NGRP and make the game more fair for

everyone. Thank you for reviewing my doc. - Yisui
